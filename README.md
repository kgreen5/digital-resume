A Resume Portfolio and also familiarizing myself with GitHub

My name is Korey Green, and I'm a senior at Mississippi State University. I am studying electrical engineering and getting a minor in mathematics. Throughout my academic years, I have had work experience through multiple internships. Learning about power systems, controls, and the utilities industry has been my favorite part. I plan to continue my learning to become a very successful electrical engineer.
